# Repository of Datasets for Line Images and Hispanic Female Names

## Description

This repository contains two datasets that can be used for various applications in machine learning, computer vision, and linguistic research. The datasets include a collection of images of vertical and horizontal lines, as well as a dataset of Hispanic female names. These datasets are designed to be versatile for research, training models, and conducting statistical or linguistic analysis.

## Datasets Included

### 1. **Vertical and Horizontal Line Images Dataset**

- **Description**: A collection of 96 images classified into two categories: horizontal lines (`0`) and vertical lines (`1`). This dataset is ideal for binary classification tasks in computer vision.
- **File Format**: PNG
- **Dataset Structure**:
  - `file_name`: The image file name.
  - `tag`: The image classification label (`0` for horizontal lines and `1` for vertical lines).
- **Total Records**: 96 images

### 2. **Hispanic Female Names Dataset**

- **Description**: A collection of over 750 unique Hispanic female names. This dataset is ideal for linguistic research, cultural diversity studies, demographic data analysis, and natural language processing applications in Spanish.
- **File Format**: CSV
- **Dataset Structure**:
  - `Nombre`: The proper name of the person.
  - `Nombre sin acentos`: The proper name without accents or diacritics.
- **Total Records**: 750+ unique names

## Usage

These datasets can be used for:

- **Machine Learning and Computer Vision**: Training models for image classification, pattern recognition, and other computer vision tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzing cultural and linguistic patterns in names in Spanish-speaking regions.
- **Academic Research**: Conducting studies on demographic, linguistic, and cultural diversity, as well as gender-based name analysis.
